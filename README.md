# 🎓 AI Capstone Concept Tracker

> A tailored project tracker for Kalvium students undertaking their AI Capstone — helping you plan, execute, and showcase concept-wise progress with clarity and purpose.

## 🚀 Overview

The **AI Capstone Concept Tracker** is a web application that simplifies the process of managing and mapping your capstone project progress to Kalvium’s official AI concepts list. Students can log tasks, associate proof-of-work (like PRs, demo links), and track which required concepts they’ve covered.

🎯 Built by students, for students — with love and code.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Student Dashboard**: View all your progress in one place.
- 🔖 **Concept Tracker**: Link specific project artifacts to AI concepts.
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Secure login and user management.
- 🧾 **Proof Uploads**: Add PR links, video links, and explanations for each concept.
- 🛠️ **RESTful APIs**: Modular backend with Express.
- 🗃️ **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase) or MongoDB Atlas.
- 🌐 **Frontend with React (Vite)**: Modern, fast, and responsive UI.
- 📦 **Deployed on Vercel & Render**: 100% free-tier stack.
